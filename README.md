# Vets Who Code Curriculum

At **Vets Who Code**, we don't just talk about coding; we live and breathe it every single day. Our battle-tested, veteran-approved curriculum follows one crystal-clear mission that's as straightforward as a drill sergeant's orders: **Retrain. Rebuild. Relaunch.**

- **Retrain** with cutting-edge technical skills that actually matter in today's competitive tech trenches: no outdated languages or theoretical fluff  
- **Rebuild** your technical confidence muscle by shipping real features people actually use, solving genuine problems for genuine users in our ecosystem  
- **Relaunch** into the tech industry with the unshakeable swagger that only comes from building production software, not just completing classroom exercises or watching endless tutorials

## Why #VetsWhoCode?

- **No more toy projects or simulation nonsense:** You'll push actual code to production systems that thousands of real users depend on daily. That resume writes itself when you've got commits that matter. While others talk about what they might build someday, you'll be showing what you shipped last sprint.  
- **Military-grade teamwork and mission focus:** The same iron discipline and squad mentality that made you successful in uniform becomes your secret weapon in code. We understand the veteran mindset because we are veterans; we've translated military excellence into software excellence, and we'll show you exactly how to leverage your service background.  
- **Built for the battlefield of modern tech:** Our curriculum isn't theoretical or academic; it's precisely mapped to what companies are desperately hiring for right now. We constantly tune our training based on direct feedback from engineering managers at top tech companies who tell us exactly what they need but can't find.  
- **Learn by doing on day one:** From your first day, you'll be learning through our own tools and applications. The same tech stack we use to run Vets Who Code becomes your training ground. You're not building throwaway projects; you're improving the very platform that serves veterans like you.

## Contributors

This curriculum wasn't built in an ivory tower classroom; it was forged in the trenches by veterans who transitioned successfully and battle-tested by industry heavyweights who actually ship software for a living. These aren't just names on a page; they're engineers who've fought through the same challenges you're facing and come out victorious on the other side.

## Curriculum Verticals

### Software Engineering

**Retrain:** From "what the heck is a function?" to "I just deployed that feature everyone's talking about" in record time. Master modern JavaScript, React, and the full deployment pipeline that powers today's web.  

**Rebuild:** Join our engineering squad and push code that real people depend on daily. Experience the full software lifecycle, from ticket creation to production monitoring, working alongside fellow veterans who've got your six.  

**Relaunch:** Walk into technical interviews with receipts, not just certificates. When they ask about your experience, you'll have git commits, pull requests, and production features to showcase instead of classroom exercises.  

**Our Tools:** You'll learn by contributing to the actual Vets Who Code platform, the same codebase that powers our operation. This isn't simulation; it's real-world engineering from day one.  

---

### Data Engineering

**Retrain:** Turn chaotic data swamps into crystal-clear intelligence that drives mission-critical decisions. Master databases, ETL processes, and the data infrastructure that powers modern companies.  

**Rebuild:** Build and maintain the mission-critical data backbone that makes our entire organization smarter every day. Create schemas, write migrations, and develop data pipelines that transform raw information into actionable insights.  

**Relaunch:** Show potential employers you've already solved the exact data problems keeping them up at night. Enter interviews with confidence backed by real-world data engineering experience that most junior candidates simply don't have.  

**Our Tools:** You'll work with the actual data systems that power Vets Who Code operations, gaining hands-on experience with the same technology stack used throughout the industry.  

---

### AI Engineering

**Retrain:** Move beyond the AI hype and buzzwords to building practical intelligent systems that actually deliver value. Learn to select, train, tune, and operationalize models that solve real business problems.  

**Rebuild:** Deploy AI capabilities that solve genuine problems across Vets Who Code projects, from content generation to predictive analytics. Create systems that augment human capabilities rather than just science experiments.  

**Relaunch:** Enter the AI engineering gold rush armed with practical experience deploying models to production, the skill companies are desperately searching for but rarely find. Stand out as someone who can translate AI potential into business reality.  

**Our Tools:** You'll enhance our platform with AI tools that serve real needs, working with the same models and frameworks used by leading tech companies.

## Continuous Track

While you're building real products that users actually touch, you're simultaneously mastering the algorithms, data structures, and computer science fundamentals that crack even the toughest technical interviews. Our continuous track ensures you develop the problem-solving muscles that tech companies test for religiously.  

We don't just prepare you for your first job; we methodically build the foundation for your fifth job and beyond, creating career longevity in an industry known for rapid change.  

Best of all, you're practicing these fundamentals by solving real problems in our codebase, not abstract puzzles disconnected from real-world engineering.

## Learning Outcomes

When you graduate from this program, you won't just have another certificate to hang on your wall; you'll have concrete evidence of your transformation:

- **Real engineering experience** that immediately separates you from the bootcamp crowd. You'll understand not just how to code, but how engineering teams actually function, communicate, and deliver value in production environments.  
- **Production code running in the wild** that you can proudly demonstrate to potential employers. Your GitHub profile will showcase pull requests, code reviews, and feature implementations that prove your ability to contribute to real codebases.  
- **Battle-tested technical confidence** that only comes from shipping features users actually depend on. You'll walk into interviews with the quiet confidence of someone who has already done the job, not just studied how to do it.  
- **Portfolio of improvements to Vets Who Code's own platform.** When asked "What have you built?" you'll point to features being used by the veteran community every day.
