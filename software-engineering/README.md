## Curriculum

### 1. Terminal (Command Line Mastery)

First stop: mastering the command line. Why? Because real engineers don't fear the terminal; they dominate it:

- File system navigation and operations  
- File permissions and user management  
- Package management (npm, pip, and more)  
- Command chaining and piping  
- Environment variables configuration  
- Shell customization and aliases  
- Git operations from the terminal (clone, branch, merge, push)  
- Server deployment, monitoring, and management  
- Deployment automation scripts  
- AI tool integration via CLI (Azure CLI, Hugging Face CLI, OpenAI CLI)  

### 2. Visual Studio Code Environment

Your IDE is your weapon. We'll optimize VS Code to make you dangerously efficient:

- Essential extensions and productivity tools  
- Workspace and user settings configuration  
- Debugging tools and breakpoint management  
- Git integration and version control  
- Task runners and build automation  
- Integrated terminal usage and customization  
- Editor shortcuts and productivity hacks  

### 3. Version Control with Git and GitHub

Git isn't optional in the real world. Master it or get left behind:

- Git fundamentals and workflows  
- Branch management strategies  
- Pull requests and code review processes  
- Merge conflict resolution  
- GitHub collaboration features  
- Repository management best practices  

### 4. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Code is only part of the battle. Understanding the entire development lifecycle separates professionals from hobbyists:

- Requirements gathering and analysis  
- Design and architecture planning  
- Software design documentation  
- Technical specifications  
- Architecture diagrams and documentation  
- API documentation  
- User stories and acceptance criteria  
- Design decision records (ADRs)  
- README and project documentation best practices  
- Implementation best practices  
- Testing strategies  
- Deployment procedures  
- Maintenance and iteration  

### 5. Planning and Kanban (Agile Workflows)

Mission planning for software teams; learn how real engineering squads coordinate:

- Agile principles and practices  
- Kanban board organization  
- Sprint planning and execution  
- Task breakdown and estimation  
- Team collaboration and communication  
- Iterative development cycles  

### 6. Web Fundamentals (JavaScript / TypeScript)

The foundational skills that separate professionals from script kiddies:

- JavaScript ES6+ features  
- TypeScript type system and benefits  
- Asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await)  
- Modern JavaScript patterns  
- Error handling and debugging  
- Performance optimization  

### 7. Component-Based Development with Next.js

Next.js isn't just another framework—it's how we build production apps that scale:

- React fundamentals and hooks  
- Next.js App Router architecture  
- Server and Client Components  
- Routing and navigation  
- Data fetching strategies  
- API routes and backend integration  
- Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR)  

### 8. Component Styling in Next.js

Making things look good isn't optional; it's part of building professional products:

- CSS Modules  
- Tailwind CSS integration  
- CSS-in-JS solutions  
- Responsive design principles  
- Accessibility considerations  
- Design system implementation  

### 9. Deployment Workflows with Vercel

Shipping to production is where the rubber meets the road. With Vercel, we deploy with confidence:

- Vercel platform fundamentals  
- Environment variables and secrets management  
- Preview deployments  
- Production deployment strategies  
- Domain configuration  
- Performance monitoring and analytics  

### 10. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Automation separates the pros from the amateurs. Set it up once, benefit forever:

- GitHub Actions workflow syntax  
- Automated testing pipelines  
- Linting and code quality checks  
- Automated deployment processes  
- Environment-specific builds  
- Monitoring and notifications  

### 11. Testing Fundamentals

Untested code is broken code. Period. Learn how we ensure quality at scale:

- Unit testing with Jest  
- Component testing strategies  
- Integration testing practices  
- End-to-end (E2E) testing with Playwright  
- Test-driven development (TDD)  
- Mocking and test fixtures  
- Code coverage metrics  
- Browser automation and visual regression testing  

### 12. Media Management with Cloudinary

Images and videos can make or break your app's performance. We'll show you how the pros handle media:

- Image and video upload workflows  
- Media transformation and optimization  
- Responsive image delivery  
- CDN integration  
- Asset organization and tagging  
- Performance optimization techniques  

### 13. Analytics with Microsoft Clarity

Building is only half the battle—understanding how users actually use your product is the other half:

- Session recording and playback  
- Heatmap analysis  
- User interaction insights  
- Performance monitoring  
- Identifying UX issues  
- Data-driven optimization strategies  

### 14. Code Challenge Preparation

We prepare you for the inevitable technical gauntlet that stands between you and your job offer:

- Array manipulation and algorithms  
- String processing techniques  
- Recursion and recursive thinking  
- Sorting algorithms (bubble, merge, quick sort)  
- Big-O notation and time complexity analysis  
- Space complexity considerations  
- Problem-solving strategies  

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this vertical, you won't just have theory—you'll have proof you can:

- Push code directly to Vets Who Code's production web application—a platform that has generated $20 million in outcomes for veterans  
- Ship features to real users on day one, not just classroom exercises  
- Build your resume with commits to a legitimate, high-impact codebase  
- Collaborate on a live project with real stakeholders and real consequences  
- Write production-quality code that meets professional engineering standards  
- Navigate the complete development lifecycle from ticket to deployment  
- Test and document features used by thousands of real veterans  
- Showcase tangible contributions that directly impact fellow veterans' careers  
- Leverage the exact same tech stack used by successful tech companies  
- Develop the confidence that only comes from building real-world software  

Unlike other programs where you build toy projects nobody uses, you'll graduate with proof you've contributed to a platform that's helped veterans secure millions in salaries and opportunities. That's a resume bullet point no bootcamp can match.

## Prerequisites

- The discipline you already learned in the military  
- The determination to push through challenges  
- The teamwork mentality that made you successful in uniform  

Everything else? We'll teach you from the ground up.
